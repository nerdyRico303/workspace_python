This repository serves as the central hub for all my Python-based projects.

## Content Brief

### 1. web_basicSortingProgram

This Python program generates a consolidated web table by integrating data from three distinct CSV files. Users can dynamically sort the table based on the following criteria:

-   Company Abbreviation
-   Start Date
-   End Date

**How to Run:** Execute the `app.py` file located within the `web_basicSortingProgram/web` directory.

**Skills Learned:**

-   Flask
-   Pandas
-   PostgreSQL (data from CSV files is fetched into a PostgreSQL database before display)
